{"name":"Two21g","tagline":"a form for h1b and other US visa queries","body":"### Welcome to 221g Pages.\r\nThe idea behind the project is to develop a smart phone application for getting visa US status. The application also provides a wiki and a forum for users to share the experiences and knowledge. The main core of the application is build with [sencha touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/) an open source java script mobile build platform to develop fast mobile applications that can be compiled for multiple plat forms . All of you who have basic javascript/php or sencha touch experience are requested to join in this project . You can contact me @ rakeshr.21@gmail.com\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Project Specifications\r\nWe are using sencha touch for the application development,for the server side scripting php is the preferred choice. Database is MySQL.\r\n\r\n### Inspiration to do the project\r\nThe idea behind the project is to have an iPhone,android and windows mobile application for all US visa seekers. Where people can post their experiences and concerns about the visa process. Currently there are no smart phone applications for this process and hence, it gave me the inspiration to come up with one. Also the process of waiting for a status change once you are put in an administrative processing is tedious. The most preferable solution is a mobile application.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\nAutomated page status requester , this section should automate the process of checking status with the consular website.\r\nA forum, where users can post and comment on queries\r\nA Knowledge base for sharing US visa based questions\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHy all you can contact me at rakeshr.21@gmail.com, to discuss more about the project and your technical queries\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
